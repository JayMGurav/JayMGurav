I'm a software developer during the day and a geek by night. Writing software is my profession, hobby, and passion. Currently cajoling code with coffee at [Decathlon](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/) and at other times I'm usually spending time with my friends and family, hacking my way through my pet projects, learning something interesting or drawling through the drably day. You might catch me playing with Javascript, React, NodeJs, GraphQL, MongoDB, Redis, TypeScript, or some shiny new thing that caught my attention.
