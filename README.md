I'm aspiring full stack software engineer and an insatiably curious lifelong autodidact who is passionate about web performance, creating scalable and distributed software architecture, UI designing and development. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup), GraphQL, NodeJs and MongoDB.
